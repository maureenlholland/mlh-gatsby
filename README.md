## Gatsby
- [quickstart setup](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/) with their basic starter theme is as easy as they say
- not too much boilerplate, nice commenting for api files

## [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)
- testing CSS-in-JS based on the Frontend Masters tutorials I've seen using it
- pros: co-located code, easy to delete a component and the styles related to it (less likely to accrue styling code debt), easy to base styles off user interactions without a lot of className manipulation
- cons: counter-intuitive to combine css and js when you learned separation of concerns as gospel, not sure what this means for the "cascading" part of css
