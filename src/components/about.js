      <p>I am extremely introverted and incredibly curious.</p>
      <p>I went to the University of Toronto for English and Cinema Studies and am as surprised as anyone that I learned to code. Turns out watching Silicon Valley while under-employed can be very motivating.</p>
      <p>The career switch fit because web development feeds both the creative and logical parts of my brain. Every day is an opportunity to build something new or fix something old.</p>
